# WindChimeLED

Sound activated LED's embedded in the tubes of a wind chime.

Arduino based project.

- 6 sensors pick up knocks and trigger 6 led's  (tested: a-piezo, b-tiltSwitch, c-copper strips, [d-piezo strip with weight, e-accelerometer chip (d/e more expensive)])
- led's quick on, then fade off
- led's brightness determined by knock value
